A Junior Research Engineer with experience in Reliability Engineering as well as Instrument and Automation Engineering, and a graduate in Control and Instrumentation Engineering. 
I possess expertise in Research and Development, Automation, Root Cause Analysis, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Troubleshooting, Preventive Action, Data Processing, Data Visualization, Continuous Improvement, Teamwork, and Leadership.
I actively pursue courses related to Data Analysis outside of work due to my interest in integrating Engineering and Business skills with data analysis. 
I believe that through data, we can accurately identify problems and develop solutions that enhance performance, product quality, and user experience.
Furthermore, my experience living in 10 cities across Indonesia and South Korea has enriched my understanding of cultural diversity and various work environments.
